## Gamification Guidelines für mobile Tourismusanwendungen

Perspectra Kommunal- u. Regionalentwicklung GmbH was tasked with developing a mobile tourism application for the local tourist association *Mühlviertel Pur*. To increase the motivation for using this app and its attractiveness in general, gamified approaches were to be included in the design. Scientific literature indicates the applicability of these approaches for touristic purposes although there are no concrete examples on how to employ them.

This project aims to identify gamification strategies that work within the context of tourism to create an additional benefit for guests as well as the businesses involved in providing the touristic infrastructure.

The results of the research were then used to create a mobile app for iOS and Android that was successfully employed for over a year. As the organization *Mühlviertel Pur* has been integrated into a joint Mühlviertel tourist association, the provided app has been discontinued and removed for downloading by mid-2016.
