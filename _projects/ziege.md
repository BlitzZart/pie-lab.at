## Educational Game Editor

The ZIEGE Game Editor is intended as an introductory game development tool for children from nine to fourteen years of age.  Entirely browser-based, it allows young game designers to use both existing game assets and add their own to create simply game levels of their own design. Users can gain some insight into the concepts involved in basic game development without requiring any previous experience with programming and then publish their game online for others to play.
