# Clockworld

The Virtual Reality installation Clockworld features the experience of controlling a virtual android on two levels: its material form and its internal mental constructs, the latter of which can be shaped by visitorsÂ´ interactions with the installation.
Clockworld forgoes one of the classical principles of animation by giving all the control to its viewers.Thus, they become the animators and can leave their own traces in this virtual world. These traces remain in the virtual memory of the installation so that past interactions are visible for future audiences.
