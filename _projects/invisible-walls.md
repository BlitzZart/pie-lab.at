When real and virtual worlds merge. *Invisible Walls* is an experimental interaction space that was developed for Austria’s largest design festival, the [Vienna Design Week](http://www.viennadesignweek.at/) 2016. Based on the [PIEdeck](../piedeck) prototype, the art installation consists of a large-scale projection, a virtual reality (VR) headset that supports hand and finger motions as input, and a sensitive laser position tracking system from the technology forge of the [Ars Electronica Futurelab](http://www.aec.at/futurelab/) in Linz. Multiple persons can move simultaneously in a 50 square meters room, affect it, thus entering into virtual and real interaction. Additionally, the VR player can get in contact with the other participants with his hands that are also represented in the VR space. With his/her fingers the VR player can manipulate the others’ virtual representation by simply pointing at them or carrying out swipe gestures. This way, *Invisible Walls* focuses on the theme of reducing the gap between the real and the virtual worlds by granting participants to interact with each other.
